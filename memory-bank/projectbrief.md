# Project Brief: Claude Code Model Switcher (CCM)

## Strategic Positioning

CCM is a strategically positioned infrastructure project within the AI tools ecosystem, using a model-switching utility as the vehicle for broader ecosystem integration and user acquisition. While appearing as a simple Bash script for switching between AI providers, the project represents sophisticated infrastructure investment with multi-layered strategic value.

## Core Value Proposition

**Tactical Layer (Visible Product):**
- Zero-config AI model switching for Claude Code IDE users
- Intelligent fallback mechanisms between official APIs and PPINFRA service
- Multi-provider support (Anthropic, DeepSeek, KIMI, GLM, Qwen, LongCat)
- Enterprise-grade features (multi-account management, security, i18n)

**Strategic Layer (Infrastructure Play):**
- Ecosystem positioning within AI provider landscape
- User acquisition through seamless zero-config experience
- Development methodology as intellectual property assets
- Partnership gateway for AI service integration

## Business Model Hypothesis

**Primary User Acquisition:**
- Zero-config experience with built-in experience keys removes friction
- Sophisticated power users gain value through multi-account management
- Enterprise features create upgrade path to premium services

**Ecosystem Integration:**
- PPINFRA partnership provides backup infrastructure and revenue sharing
- GLM-4.6 official partnership validates ecosystem position
- Multi-provider support creates neutral ground in AI landscape

**Methodology Monetization:**
- Sophisticated development workflows (spec-driven, EARS requirements) as assets
- Agent templates and development infrastructure as IP
- Strategic positioning for enterprise AI tools consulting/services

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Integration Superiority:** Deep Claude Code IDE integration vs. generic model-switching tools
2. **Zero-Config Experience:** Built-in experience keys vs. API key management overhead
3. **Intelligent Fallback:** PPINFRA backup service vs. single-point failures
4. **Sophisticated User Management:** Multi-account Claude Pro management vs. single-user tools
5. **Security-First Design:** Token masking, keychain integration vs. plaintext configurations

## Strategic Risks

**Technical Risks:**
- Dependency on PPINFRA service reliability
- Authentication conflicts with Claude Code's native auth
- API endpoint changes across multiple providers

**Business Risks:**
- Claude Code native feature integration could obviate need
- Provider relationships could change (termination, terms)
- Market fragmentation in AI provider landscape

**Execution Risks:**
- Over-engineering could alienate simple-use-case users
- Strategic complexity could distract from core product value
- Resource allocation between tactical product vs. strategic infrastructure

## Success Metrics

**Product Metrics:**
- Daily active users and model switching frequency
- Conversion rate from zero-config to paid API usage
- Error rates and fallback service utilization

**Strategic Metrics:**
- Partnership integration count and quality
- Enterprise user adoption and multi-account usage
- Development methodology adoption and IP value

**Ecosystem Metrics:**
- Provider relationship strength and revenue sharing
- Cross-platform integration opportunities
- Influence on Claude Code IDE feature development

## Development Philosophy

**Infrastructure-First Development:**
- Build tactical products that serve as strategic infrastructure
- Invest in methodology and processes that scale beyond immediate needs
- Create intellectual property through sophisticated development practices
- Maintain simplicity at user interface layer while building complexity in strategic layer

**Ecosystem Thinking:**
- Design for integration rather than isolation
- Create value through partnerships and network effects
- Position as neutral ground in competitive AI landscape
- Enable rather than compete with core platform capabilities

## Timeline Horizon

**Short-term (0-6 months):**
- Product maturity and user base growth
- Partnership development and integration refinement
- Documentation and user experience optimization

**Medium-term (6-18 months):**
- Ecosystem expansion beyond model switching
- Enterprise features and business model refinement
- Development methodology validation and IP development

**Long-term (18+ months):**
- Strategic infrastructure position in AI tools ecosystem
- Potential acquisition or partnership opportunities
- Platform evolution beyond Claude Code IDE integration

## Resource Requirements
